# Skittles Chromatography Experiment

## Title
**Separation of Skittles Dyes Using Paper Chromatography**

## Abstract
This experiment demonstrates the principles of paper chromatography by separating the dyes found in Skittles candies. Using coffee filters as the stationary phase and a mixture of water and rubbing alcohol as the mobile phase, the different dyes are separated based on their affinities to each phase. The results show distinct color bands, indicating the presence of multiple dyes within each Skittle.

## Introduction
Chromatography is a method used to separate mixtures into their individual components. This technique is widely used in chemistry and biochemistry for the identification and purification of substances. In this experiment, we will utilize paper chromatography to separate the dyes in Skittles. Understanding the principles of stationary and mobile phases is crucial for grasping how chromatography works. The stationary phase remains fixed, while the mobile phase moves through it, carrying the sample components with it. Different components travel at different rates, leading to their separation.

The purpose of this experiment is to see how different dyes in Skittles candies can be separated using paper chromatography. By observing the separated dyes, we can learn more about the composition of the colors used in Skittles.

## Hypothesis
Different dyes in Skittles will separate and travel up the coffee filter at different rates, resulting in distinct colored bands.

## Materials
- Skittles
- Coffee filters
- Water
- Rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol)
- Small cups or containers
- Toothpicks or cotton swabs
- Ruler
- Pencil
- Tape
- Plate or dish

## Procedure
1. **Prepare the Coffee Filters**:
   - Cut the coffee filters into strips approximately 1 inch wide and 6 inches long.
   - Draw a line with a pencil about 1 inch from the bottom of each strip. This baseline is where you’ll place the candy dye.

2. **Extract the Candy Dye**:
   - Place a few drops of water on a plate or dish.
   - Place a Skittle on the water drop and let it sit for a minute. The dye from the Skittle will dissolve into the water.
   - Use a toothpick or cotton swab to transfer a small drop of the colored water onto the baseline of the coffee filter. Let it dry and repeat if necessary to get a concentrated spot of dye.

3. **Prepare the Solvent**:
   - Mix a small amount of rubbing alcohol with water in a cup or container. A typical ratio is 1 part rubbing alcohol to 3 parts water.

4. **Develop the Chromatogram**:
   - Tape the top of the coffee filter strip to a pencil and balance the pencil across the top of the cup or container so that the strip hangs down.
   - Ensure that the bottom of the paper strip (below the baseline) is immersed in the solvent without the dye spot being submerged.
   - Allow the solvent to travel up the paper. As it moves, it will carry the dyes with it, separating them based on their different affinities to the coffee filter and the solvent.

5. **Observe the Results**:
   - When the solvent has traveled most of the way up the coffee filter (but before it reaches the top), remove the strip and let it dry.
   - Observe the different colors that have separated from the original dye spot. You’ll likely see several distinct bands of color, indicating the different dyes used in the Skittle.

## Results
The experiment successfully separated the dyes in Skittles. Here are the detailed observations and measurements:

- **Red Skittle**: Two distinct bands observed. The first band was red and traveled 4.5 cm from the baseline. The second band was pink and traveled 3.2 cm from the baseline.
- **Blue Skittle**: Two distinct bands observed. The first band was blue and traveled 5.0 cm from the baseline. The second band was light blue and traveled 2.8 cm from the baseline.
- **Yellow Skittle**: One distinct band observed. The yellow dye traveled 4.2 cm from the baseline.

Here is the recorded data in tabular form:

| Skittle Color | Dye Color 1 | Distance Traveled (cm) | Dye Color 2 | Distance Traveled (cm) | Dye Color 3 | Distance Traveled (cm) |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Red           | Red         | 4.5                    | Pink        | 3.2                    |             |                        |
| Blue          | Blue        | 5.0                    | Light Blue  | 2.8                    |             |                        |
| Yellow        | Yellow      | 4.2                    |             |                        |             |                        |

## Discussion
In the discussion section, we interpret and analyze the results:

- **Comparison with Hypothesis**: The results supported the hypothesis. Different dyes in Skittles did separate and traveled up the coffee filter at different rates, resulting in distinct colored bands. For example, the blue dye traveled further up the filter compared to the red and yellow dyes.
- **Separation Mechanism**: Different dyes moved at different rates due to their solubility in the solvent and their affinity for the stationary phase. Dyes that are more soluble in the mobile phase (the water and alcohol mixture) traveled further up the paper, while dyes that bind more strongly to the stationary phase (the coffee filter) moved more slowly.
- **Interactions**: The properties of the dyes and their interactions with the stationary and mobile phases led to the observed separations. Larger dye molecules generally moved more slowly, while smaller dye molecules traveled faster.
- **Unexpected Findings**: There were no significant unexpected results. All the dyes separated as anticipated, forming distinct bands.
- **Limitations**: One limitation of the experiment was the quality of the coffee filter, which might not provide as clear separation as chromatography paper. Additionally, the precision of measurements could be improved with more accurate tools.
- **Future Experiments**: Future experiments could test other types of candies, use different solvents, or try chromatography paper instead of coffee filters. This could help refine the separation process and provide more detailed results.

### Discussion Topics to Inspire Students
- **Real-world Applications of Chromatography**: Chromatography is used in forensic science to analyze substances, in environmental testing to check for pollutants, and in pharmaceuticals to ensure the purity of medications.
- **Chemical Properties of Dyes**: The molecular structure of dyes affects their movement in chromatography. Different chemicals interact differently with solvents and stationary phases.
- **Exploration and Curiosity**: Encourage students to think about other mixtures they could separate using chromatography. What other everyday items could they test, such as inks, food coloring, or plant pigments?

## Conclusion
